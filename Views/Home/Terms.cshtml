        <li>E.	ILLEGAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY. Any promotion of illegal business activity, including without limitation multi-level marketing (except in compliance with the FTC’s Business Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing, see <a href="www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/business-guidance-concerning-multi-level-marketing">www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/business-guidance-concerning-multi-level-marketing</a> ), promoting the sale or use of illegal drugs (including but not limited to Marijuana-derived CBD Oil); or infringing or promoting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of another.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <p>In addition to the foregoing, Tsaishen requires you to follow these best practices when sending electronic communications:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>•	Use only permission-based marketing electronic communications lists (i.e., lists in which each recipient affirmatively opted-in to receiving those electronic communications).</li>
        <li>•	Always include a working “unsubscribe” mechanism in each marketing electronic communication that allows the recipient to opt out from your mailing list (receipt/transactional messages that are exempt from “unsubscribe” requirements of applicable law are exempt from this requirement).</li>
        <li>•	Comply with all requests from recipients to be removed from your mailing list within the earlier of ten (10) days of receipt of the request, or the deadline under applicable law.</li>
        <li>•	Maintain, publish, and comply with a privacy policy that meets all applicable legal requirements, whether or not you control the sending of the electronic communications, and include a link to such privacy policy in your electronic communications.</li>
        <li>•	Include in each electronic communication a link to your then-current privacy policy applicable to that electronic communication.</li>
        <li>•	Include in each electronic communication your valid physical mailing address or a link to that information.</li>
        <li>•	Do not send electronic communications to addresses obtained from purchased or rented lists.</li>
        <li>•	Do not use third party electronic addresses, domain names, or mail servers without proper permission from the third party.</li>
        <li>•	Do not routinely send electronic communications to non-specific addresses (e.g., webmaster@domain.com or info@domain.com).</li>
        <li>•	Do not engage in spamming.</li>
        <li>•	Do not disguise the origin, or subject matter of, any electronic communications or falsify or manipulate the originating message address, subject line, header, or transmission path information for any electronic communication.</li>
        <li>•	Do not send offers to obtain or attempt to obtain personal information, or generate leads, for third parties.</li>
        <li>•	Do not send “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or other types of electronic messages that encourage the recipient to forward the content to strangers.</li>
        <li>•	Do not send to lists of addresses that are programmatically generated or scraped from the Internet.</li>
        <li>•	Do not employ sending practices, or have overall message delivery rates, which may cause harm to our services or other users of our services.</li>
        <li>•	Do not send messages that may be considered junk mail.  Some examples of these types of messages include, but are not limited to, messaging related to penny stocks, gambling, multi-level marketing (except in compliance with the FTC’s Business Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing, see <a href="www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/business-guidance-concerning-multi-level-marketing">www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/business-guidance-concerning-multi-level-marketing</a> ), direct to consumer pharmaceutical sales, and payday loans.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <p>You further agree to conduct yourself and all of your businesses in full compliance with all applicable laws, whether through the use of Tsaishen or otherwise.</p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 3 – OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></h5>
    <p>We respect your privacy and the use and protection of your non-public, personal information.  Your submission of personal information through the Website is governed by our Privacy Policy.  Our Privacy Policy may be viewed at <a href="~/Home/PrivacyPolicy">https://www.Tsaishen.co/privacy</a> . Tsaishen reserves the right to modify its Privacy Policy in its reasonable discretion from time-to-time.  Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 4 – INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE; REGISTRATION; PASSWORDS; PROHIBITION AGAINST HOSTING THIRD-PARTY AGENCY ACCOUNTS</b></h5>
    <p>As a Tsaishen user, you will be required to create an account with Tsaishen.  You warrant that the information you provide us is truthful and accurate, and that you are not impersonating another person.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password you may use to access your Tsaishen user account, and you agree not to transfer your password or user name, or lend or otherwise transfer your use of or access to your user account, to any third party.  So called “agency accounts,” or accounts in which you host for third parties, are prohibited. Should your usage data indicate, in Tsaishen’ sole and exclusive discretion, that you are operating an agency account, you will be subject to cancellation of your Tsaishen user account or enhanced pricing for your Tsaishen user account, at Tsaishen’ sole and exclusive discretion.  You are fully responsible for all transactions with, and information conveyed to, Tsaishen under your user account.  You agree to immediately notify Tsaishen of any unauthorized use of your password or user name or any other breach of security related to your user account. You agree that Tsaishen is not liable, and you will hold Tsaishen harmless, for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations. Please see Section 20 below for additional information.</p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 5 – ORDER PLACEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE</b></h5>
    <p>If you order a service or product, payment must be received by us before your order is accepted.  We may require additional information regarding your order if any required information was missing or inaccurate, and may cancel or limit an order any time after it has been placed.  Your electronic order confirmation, or any form of confirmation, does not signify our acceptance of your order. You must contact us immediately at <a href="support@Tsaishen.co">support@Tsaishen.co</a> in order to modify or cancel your pending order.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to amend your order in accordance with your instructions. </p>
    <p>All items are subject to availability.  We will notify you if any item is not available, the expected availability date, and may offer you an alternative product or service.  If the availability of any product or service is delayed and you do not wish to substitute the product or service, upon your request, we will cancel your order and if previously charged, your payment card will be fully refunded for that specific order.  We reserve the right to limit the sales of our products and services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis at our sole and exclusive discretion.  </p>
    <p>Your purchase order of products and other services is conditioned on you re-affirming your acceptance of this Agreement.  </p>
    <p>All advertised prices are in, and all payments shall be in, U.S. Dollars</p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 6 – REFUNDS FOR HARD GOODS</b></h5>
    <p>If you have purchased a “hard good” (for example, a book or other tangible product) from Tsaishen or any related brands, you may receive a limited refund if you comply with the following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>1. You must request a refund in writing by contacting support@Tsaishen.co;</li>
        <li>2. Your request for a refund must be made within thirty (30) days of your purchase;</li>
        <li>3. You must return the hard goods to Tsaishen immediately, according to the shipping and other instructions you will receive by email after requesting a refund;</li>
        <li>4. The hard goods must be returned to Tsaishen in like-new, or re-sellable condition, as determined in Tsaishen’ sole, reasonable discretion.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5><b>SECTION 7 - TRIAL OFFER, AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT AND PAYMENT, AND CANCELLATION</b></h5>
    <p>Where we offer you a free trial of Tsaishen, such free trial will start immediately after your registration and continue for the free trial offer period as indicated on the Website at the time you register.  Free trial subscriptions are only available to new subscribers of Tsaishen and for the limited periods as set out on the Website. Previous subscribers or those subscribers who have already benefited from a free trial subscription to Tsaishen do not qualify for a further free trial period.</p>
    <p><b>If you do not want to continue your subscription after your free trial comes to an end, you must submit a cancellation request through your payment provider you have signed up with.  If you do not cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before your free trial period ends, your subscription will automatically continue and the payment card that you provided at the time of enrolment online will be charged the full Tsaishen monthly membership subscription rate provided at the time of enrollment each month until you cancel.</b> Tsaishen can change the monthly membership subscription rate at any time.  If the membership subscription rate changes after you subscribe, we will notify you by e-mail and give you an opportunity to cancel.</p>
    <p>If you wish to cancel your Tsaishen subscription at any time after a free trial or discounted period ends, you must submit a cancellation request via your payment provider you have signed up with.  If you reach out to us for cancellation of your monthly subscription, we require at least ten (10) days’ notice of cancellation by e-mail using <a href="support@Tsaishen.co">support@Tsaishen.co</a> .  If you provide such notice less than ten (10) days before the first day of your next subscription month, your credit card may still be charged. You will not be entitled to pro-rate your last month’s use, nor will you be entitled to any refund for any payments to Tsaishen. </p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 8 – SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND AUTOMATIC PAYMENT </b></h5>
    <p>A Tsaishen user is responsible for paying all sums due to Tsaishen in connection with their monthly subscription in accordance with these Terms.  The first fee payable in accordance with these Terms is due when the user account is set up and payment of the monthly fee is a condition of access, or after your free trial ends and you have not canceled the automatic subscription with us.  Every calendar month, your account will be charged the subscription fee plus applicable tax for the following month’s subscription, together with any other fees for the following month’s subscription plus any accumulated charges for the past period (collectively, “Fees”).  Failure by the Tsaishen user to use any of the services available through the service provided by Tsaishen does not relieve the Tsaishen user of their payment obligations under these Terms. </p>
    <p>Potential users can pay by credit card or debit card.  Payment details shall be collected by us through our secure financial data collection mechanism. You acknowledge and agree that we hold data relating to the transaction, including the last four digits and the expiration date of the card used to purchase the products or services together with details on when payment is due. <b>You further acknowledge and agree that payments are due on a recurring basis in accordance with the payment terms for the specific service purchased (unless the subscription is cancelled in accordance with these Terms) and therefore authorize the automatic payment collection terms applicable to that specific service (e.g., on a monthly basis and for a specific amount).  </b></p>
    <p>IF YOU ARE A TSAISHEN USER WITH A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A VALID CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBER OR AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHOD, EACH PAYMENT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED AT THE TIME OF YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT DATE (MONTHLY) AND WILL BE BILLED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDED TO US AT THE TIME OF YOUR ENROLLMENT.  IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO TSAISHEN, YOU MUST DO SO THROUGH YOUR PAYMENT PROVIDER YOU USED AT THE TIME YOU SIGNED UP OR BY E-MAILING <a href="SUPPORT@TSAISHEN.CO">SUPPORT@TSAISHEN.CO</a> AT LEAST TEN (10) DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR NEXT SUBSCRIPTION MONTH.</p>
    <p>Tsaishen reserves the right to immediately terminate a user’s account and/or service for any unpaid (in whole or part) period of the subscription (with or without notice).  Termination of service in no way relieves or excuses the user from any obligation to pay outstanding charges or expenses. In the event Tsaishen starts collection processes of any type, you will be liable for all collection costs, including legal fees and expenses, as provided in Section 20 below. </p>
    <p>In addition to any Fees, Tsaishen may also charge applicable value added or other tax.</p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 9 – SHIPPING FEES</b></h5>
    <p>Unless otherwise stated on the Website at the time of purchase, if we ship you a physical product, we reserve the right to add applicable shipping and handling fees to your order.  Unless otherwise stated, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your order within a reasonable time after receipt of your properly completed and verified order. Accurate shipping address and phone number information is required. Although we may provide delivery or shipment timeframes or dates, such dates are good-faith estimates and are subject to change.  If your order will be delayed, we will contact you at the e-mail address you provided when placing your order. If we are unable to contact you or you would like to cancel your order, we will cancel the order and refund the full amount charged. We shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense related to any delay in shipment or delivery caused by any third party carrier or other delivery service not owned or controlled by us.  The risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to any third party carrier.  </p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 10 – PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICES AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE</b></h5>
    <p>Products, services, and prices are generally posted on our website, but are subject to change. Tsaishen reserves the right, without notice, to discontinue products or services or modify specifications and prices on products and services without incurring any obligation to you.  Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms, any price changes to your subscription or purchase of product(s) or services will take effect following email notice to you.</p>
    <p>Price changes are effective on the first day of the month after the price change is posted. By accessing, using, subscribing or placing an order over the Website, you authorize Tsaishen to charge your account in the amount indicated for the value of the services you select, including any future price changes. If you request a downgrade in services, the downgrade (and corresponding price reduction) will become effective on the first day of the month following your requested downgrade. By your continued use of Tsaishen services, and unless you terminate your subscription as provided herein, you agree that Tsaishen may charge your credit card monthly for the products and services you have selected, and you consent to any price changes for such services after e-mail notice has been provided to you.</p>
    <p>Tsaishen takes reasonable steps in an effort to insure that the prices set forth on the Website are correct, and to accurately describe and display the items available on the Website.  If the correct price of our product is higher than its stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. </p>
    <p>When ordering products or services, please note that Tsaishen does not warrant that product or service descriptions are accurate, complete, current, or error-free, or that packaging will match the actual product that you receive.  All sales are deemed final except as provided in Section 6 of these Terms. Tsaishen’ descriptions of, or references to, products or services not owned by Tsaishen are not intended to imply endorsement of that product or service, or constitute a warranty by Tsaishen.</p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 11 – DISCLAIMER - YOUR INDIVIDUAL RESULTS WILL VARY</b></h5>
    <p>Every investment opportunity is different, with varying strategic approaches, property locations, entity structures, economic outlooks, etc. Therefore, individual results will vary from user to user. YOUR INDIVIDUAL RESULTS WILL VARY DEPENDING UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS UNIQUE TO YOUR BUSINESS AND INVESTING PRACTICE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO YOUR PURCHASE PRICE, BUSINESS MODEL, PROPERTY LOCATION AND USE.  </p>
    <p><b>Tsaishen does not promise, guarantee, or warrant your success, income, or sales. You understand and acknowledge that Tsaishen will not at any time provide sales leads or referrals to you or your business. Those businesses who purchase our products or services will receive access to software and tools to locate deals available online and otherwise assist with their respective research.  However, we do not guarantee your success and based upon many market factors that we cannot control, the software and tools we provide may or may not be applicable to your specific business.  Further, we do not make earnings claims, efforts claims, return on investment claims, or claims that our software, tools, or other offerings will make your business or investment effort any specific amount of money, and it is possible that you will not earn your investment back.  We do not sell a business opportunity, “get rich quick” program, guaranteed system, franchise system, or a business in a box. You should not purchase our products or services if that is your expectation. Instead, you should purchase with the understanding that using the information and software purchased will take time and effort and may be applicable in some situations but not others.  Also, we do not offer any tax, accounting, financial, or legal advice. You should consult your accountant, attorney, or financial advisor for advice on these topics. </b></p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 12 – YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN RUNNING YOUR BUSINESS</b></h5>
    <p>You agree that you and your business will only use Tsaishen’s products and services for lawful purposes and that you shall not use such products or services, whether alone or in connection with other software, hardware, or services, for any unlawful or harmful purpose.  You are solely and exclusively responsible for complying with any and all applicable laws and regulations in running your business, including, but not limited to, all laws governing advertising and marketing claims, subscriptions, refunds, premium offers, sales, rentals, improvements, tax laws, and all additional laws applicable to your business.  Tsaishen shall have no liability for your violation of any laws. You are solely and exclusively responsible for all due diligence prior to making any purchase or investment, collecting and reporting any and all sales and use tax, and any other taxes, which may apply to sales of products or services by your business including, but not limited to, taxes which may apply to voluntary donations provided by your customers (as described in Section 13 below).  Tsaishen shall not be responsible to collect or report any taxes which may apply to your business or sales of products or services by your business. You agree to indemnify Tsaishen as set out in Section 20 below in the event that you and/or your business violates any law and a claim is threatened or asserted against Tsaishen as a result. </p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 13 – OPTIONAL ORDER “ROUND UPS” FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND POTENTIAL TAX IMPLICATIONS  </b></h5>
    <p>Tsaishen, in its sole and exclusive discretion, may provide an opportunity for you to voluntarily “round up” purchases at checkout by various dollar amounts, such as one, three, five, or ten dollars, to be donated to charitable organizations under Canadian and United States law, respectively, that are tax-exempt under Section 149 of the Canadian Income Tax Act and Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (each, individually, “Charity”).  Tsaishen agrees to keep any “round up” donations in a separate, non-interest bearing account pending contribution of such amounts to the Charity. Any amounts constituting “round up” donations shall be irreversibly transferred to Tsaishen, as agent and nominee for the Charity. You understand and agree that you shall not be entitled to any refund of any “round up” donations.  You further understand and agree that “round up” donations may not be tax deductible by you. You understand and agree that Tsaishen is acting as nominee and agent of the Charity with regards to any “round up” donations and, pursuant thereto, Tsaishen shall transfer such amounts to the Charity as soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after receipt of each donation.</p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 14 – COMMISSIONS PROGRAM AND INDEPENDENT TSAISHEN AFFILIATE PROGRAM</b></h5>
    <p>If you are a Tsaishen’ user who chooses to sign up as an affiliate, you will have the opportunity to receive a commission (“Commission”) when another person (a “Prospect”) creates a Tsaishen account by using your Affiliate Link, the trial period expires, the Prospect makes payment, and a “Sale” is registered (each such account is a “Sold Account.”)  </p>
    <p>The amount of the Commission is currently 20%. Once a Commission of $100 (USD) or more is earned, you will need to register with our third-party payment provider to receive payment. This means you will be authorizing third party companies to contact you.  Before you can be paid, you must provide certain information (such as, but not necessarily limited to a completed W-8 or W-9). If you do not complete the requisite information within 120 days of earning your Commission, you will be deemed to have permanently waived all rights to the Commission.  If you are not a resident of the United States, taxes (including without limitation VAT) may be withheld where required by applicable law. You are solely responsible for complying with all tax laws in your respective jurisdiction(s) including, but not limited to, the payment of all required taxes to, and filing of all returns and other required documents with, the applicable governing body(ies). </p>
    <p>Tsaishen may offer you an opportunity to become an independent Tsaishen Affiliate (“Affiliate”), wherein you have the opportunity to earn additional money for Tsaishen accounts that you sell to other users. Tsaishen reserves the sole and exclusive right to determine the amount of remuneration each Affiliate will receive in exchange for the Affiliate’s efforts.  Affiliate commission is further discussed in the Tsaishen Affiliate Agreement. </p>
    <p>For avoidance of doubt, Affiliates are independent contractors and are not employees or agents of Tsaishen.  Affiliates have no authority to act on behalf of or bind Tsaishen. Affiliates shall be solely and exclusively responsible for all costs and other expenses incurred.  Sections 18 and 20 below – in their entirety (as well as all other terms in this Agreement) – apply to Affiliates, and further govern the relationship between Tsaishen and each Affiliate.   </p>
    <p>To find out more information about the Affiliate program and the additional terms that apply, please visit Affiliates link at the bottom of our Website. <i>For avoidance of doubt, all Sections of these Terms and Conditions apply to you in your role as Affiliate, unless expressly provided otherwise. </i></p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 15 – TESTIMONIALS, REVIEWS, AND PICTURES/VIDEOS</b></h5>
    <p>Tsaishen is pleased to hear from users and customers and welcomes your comments regarding our services and products.  Tsaishen may use testimonials and/or product reviews in whole or in part together with the name, city, and state of the person submitting it.  Testimonials may be used for any form of activity relating to Tsaishen’ services or products, in printed and online media, as Tsaishen determines in its sole and exclusive discretion.  Testimonials represent the unique experience of the participants and customers submitting the testimonial, and do not necessarily reflect the experience that you and your business may have using our services or products.  As set forth above in Section 11, your results will vary depending upon a variety of factors unique to you and market forces beyond Tsaishen’ control. Note that testimonials, photographs, and other information that you provide to us will be treated as non-confidential and nonproprietary, and, by providing them, you grant Tsaishen a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive and irrevocable license to use them.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Tsaishen reserves the right to correct grammatical and typing errors, to shorten testimonials prior to publication or use, and to review all testimonials prior to publication or use.  Tsaishen shall be under no obligation to use any, or any part of, any testimonial or product review submitted.  </p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 18 – LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES</b></h5>
    <p>EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL TSAISHEN OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS, AND/OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRIVACY POLICY, THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, YOUR OR A THIRD PARTY’S USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY SOFTWARE, SERVICE, OR PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER TSAISHEN HAS HAD NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS, OR CLAIMS.

    <h5><b>SECTION 19 – DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b></h5>
    <p>PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR AND YOUR BUSINESS’ RIGHTS.  EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</p>
    <p>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.  HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.</p>
    <p>If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us at <a href="support@Tsaishen.co">support@Tsaishen.co</a> to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, any affiliate agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 19 and 20 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Providence County, Rhode Island, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration.  The AAA’s Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale, the Privacy Policy, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Tsaishen.</p>
    <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules.  In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>
    <p>The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Rhode Island without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.  Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>You and Tsaishen agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  You and Tsaishen expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.</p>
    <p>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).</p>
    <p>This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.  </p>
    <p>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Tsaishen, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer.  If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.  If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.  </p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 20 – TSAISHEN’ ADDITIONAL REMEDIES</b></h5>

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting Tsaishen from pursuing in court any other remedies available to it for such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement, including the recovery of monetary damages from you and your business. You and your business hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the courts of Providence County, Rhode Island for all such claims, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ exclusive jurisdiction or venue.  </p>

    <h5><b>SECTION 25 – NO WAIVER</b></h5>
    <p>No failure or delay on the part of Tsaishen in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement may operate as a waiver, nor may any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or remedy, or the exercise of any other rights, power, or remedy under this Agreement.
