            <h2 class="f40 f40_start_mobile">78% of adults in USA believe that investing in real estate is the best and fastest way to create and preserve wealth!</h2>

            <h3 class="f30 f30_start" style="line-height: inherit;">
                But only 13% do! Our question is WHY?!   <br />
                We believe that there are 5 main reasons
            </h3>

                <span class="big-number big-number-one">1</span>
                <h3 class="f80 two_f80">Cost</h3>
                <div class="one_mobile_p">
                    <p>Over the last few decades we’ve seen a rise in property prices. Since the crash of 2008 the prices in most places are right back at the same level and even higher in some cities. Individuals looking to invest in real estate simply can’t find great deals, where the price makes (as compared to value or rent that it can demand). Basically, the math doesn’t work.</p>
                    <p>And how do you know whether the math makes sense? </p>
                    <p>Simply compare the price you pay (asking price) to the current market value. Are they the same? </p>
                    <p>If they are, you are leaving much of your wealth to the hope and pray strategy that market will appreciate. Read: <span class="strong">you are taking a lot of risk.</span></p>
                    <p>If your plan is to rent, what is the rent to price ratio?! If you are not taking at least 1% in rent, you might be exposing yourself to negative cash flow (meaning YOU LOSING MONEY every single month). Sure, sometimes you can make the math work for as little as 0.5%, but that too is very risky. As any minor movement swings you from profits to losses. </p>
                    <p>What you want to do is find deals that you can purchase well below the market value!</p>
                    <p>Why?</p>
                    <p>Keep reading and we promise to explain exactly why in a bit…</p>

                <h3 class="f80 two_title">Finding Deals</h3>
                <div class="two-mobile-p">
                    <p>The second and maybe even bigger reason is ability to find deals, or as some like to call it a “deal flow”. Because vast majority of people don’t know where to look, they enlist help of the local realtor, hoping that will expand and speed up their search. They typically drive around the local market, hoping to see a property for sale well below the market price, to give them enough equity to get in.</p>
                    <p>But here is the problem, most sellers are very smart these days. They too have access to Zillow and have at least a range of what price they can demand.  They too have access to realtors who can advise them (for free) of what the price of their property should be. And unless you find someone desperate for cash that hasn’t heard of re-financing or home equity loan or line of credit, you will know on many, many doors and walk out empty-handed.</p>
                    <p>As for realtors, yes, you’ll likely get more deals showing up in your inbox, however don’t expect that any of them will have a good price to value difference.</p>
                    <p>And in case you are super-new to the world of real estate, let us break something else down for you…</p>
                    <p>You’ve likely enlisted the “buyer’s agent” who told you that their service is free – meaning you don’t have to pay them a penny, they only get paid when the deal is closed, and the seller will pay for that. Are we right?!</p>
                    <p>But here is the reality… sellers know that they will have to pay 5-8% of the sale price to the realtors. And they also have a solid expectation of what they’d like to make out of the deal. So price is adjusted to reflect that payment. </p>
                    <p>So, who ultimately pays for the realtors? YOU, the buyer!</p>
                    <p>And while we think it’s cool that they get paid for the service they provide (they do work many hours) we also think it’s fair for you to understand that it’s not free.</p>

                <div class="three_mobile_p">
                    <p>Even if you know exactly where to go to find great deals online, you’ll most likely end up sifting through 100,000’s of web pages and looking at well over 100 deals just to find 1 deal that makes sense. </p>
                    <p>For experienced investors, this can take about 1 hour per deal. For those starting out, this process can take 3-5 hours per deal or longer. </p>
                    <p>So, if you look at 100 deals and you spend 1-3 hours per deal, that means you are spending 100-300 hours before you can find a great deal. </p>
                    <p>To put this in perspective,<strong> you are spending anywhere between 2.5 and 7.5 workweeks just to find one deal.</strong> </p>
                    <p style=" font-size:19px">That’s over 2 months of searching!</p>
                    <p>And that’s if you can afford spending about 40-hours per week for the entirety of those 2 months looking at what’s out there. If you can’t, that process can take 4-6 months or longer!</p>
                    <p>And then, once you find the deal, you’ll need to spend another 10-50 hours in due diligence (basically a research to tell you whether your initial gut reaction and evaluations were right). </p>
                    <p>That’s simply a lot of time!</p>
                    <p>And you are also competing with other investors who are likely looking at the same deal.</p>
                    <p>The one that finds it faster and can do their research faster wins! And if that’s not you, now you’re back onto another 2+ months of searching!</p>

                    <p>And the process looks something like this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find the pre-foreclosure or distressed property by driving around your neighborhood and looking for signs of distress (overgrown lawn, roof in need of repair, peeling paint, boarded up windows…), or look at obituaries and see if any of those folks had a property being left to the next of kin, or search for foreclosure filings by visiting this site, that site and these articles…</li>
                        <li>Do a quick property research by looking here, here, and here</li>
                        <li>Send a letter to the owner using one of the pre-scripted letters that basically tells them you understand they might be in trouble and you’d like to help. Ask for a phone call or a visit. Or if you are bold enough, just make an offer (typically obscenely low)</li>
                        <li>Call to follow up or send another letter</li>
                        <li>If you get into negotiations, show them how your tiny offer actually helps them and saves them</li>
                        <li>If they accept buy it</li>

                <p>You feel awful about who you’re becoming and feel embarrassed to tell your friends, family, spouse or kids how you basically take advantage of people when they are at their lowest and spinning it as if you’re doing them a favor!

                <p>YUCK!</p>
                <p>You realize that’s not who you are nor who you wish to become. Soon enough you stop. </p>
                <p>Some of you get so distraught by the process that you start resenting real estate, investing, and money altogether and create false beliefs that EVERYONE who’s in it must have done it the “yucky” way. You give up on investing completely.</p>
                <p>Others decide that maybe stocks are better… at least you’re not taking advantage of others… sometimes forgetting that often you are being taken advantage of by the market manipulations and fake news.</p>

                <p>Even though there are problems with traditional way to invest in real estate, it still makes it a great investment and one of the best performing assets in the history of investing… going back to the beginning of civilization.</p>
                <p>There are only a few assets that one can invest in:</p>
                <p>While there are subcategories within each, these are the basic investment options one has. And as you can see from the visual, real estate allows you to participate in all of the asset classes.</p>
                <p>It provides equity, especially when you buy well, ability to utilize debt and finance the property, and finally the commodities are used in the products itself (lumber, copper, etc.).</p>
                <p>But that’s not where the power of real estate comes in. True <b>power of real estate ownership</b> comes from <b>what it can do for the investor</b> in creating and preserving wealth.</p>
                <p>You’ve likely heard it called an <b>IDEAL asset:</b></p>

                                    <p>We’ll explain some more intricacies in a bit, using the example of crowdfunding and syndications, but there are a few keen differences between those that we’d like to point out here.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        We like to look at Wall Street like a casino. As a matter of fact, we call it just that,<strong> Wall Street Casino</strong>: <q>While you may win every, ultimately the house never loses!</q>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even the best investors call entry points “bets” (just listen to Ray Dalio, arguably one of the most successful investors) and that is for a reason. When you get into a Wall Street Casino, you are speculating (guessing) of what may happen and in which direction the prices may go. Aside from lack of control of what the company or leadership does, you depend on the market (meaning millions of people out there) behavior and beliefs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If that wasn’t complex enough,<strong> market and the prices are easily manipulated </strong> in the background and not made public. And those manipulations are not to your benefit, just in case you were wondering.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There are many ways to manipulate the market and the stock price, some illegal and some legal, but, in our opinion, unethical.

                                        Nowadays humans are not the only gamblers inside the casino. The place is filled with <strong> highly sophisticated robots </strong> that do all the buying and selling, using specially designed algorithms to make money for, you guessed it, guys who built them, and they can do it so fast that it would make your head spin.
                                    </p>



                                    <p>
                                        And look, we got nothing against bots! Heck we use them to. But, we tend to believe in using them for good and not being evil.

                                        For example, Robinhood (popular app allowing you to gamble in the casino free of fees) uses their customer data to make the profit and beat their customer! YUP, their own customer is used as a product!

                                        Here is how it works:

                                    <ul>

                                        <li>
                                            During those few seconds, Robinhood bots, knowing your estimated price,
                                            <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                                                <li>
                                                    have traded that stock multiple times already (this is done in milliseconds), making the money on the spread (the difference between buy and sell price) AND/OR
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    have purchased those 10 shares BELOW your price and then SOLD THEM TO YOU at the price you agreed to pay, making HUGE PROFITS in the process
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>

                                            When you decide to sell, they use the exact same process in reverse, basically doubling or tripling money every time you press that button.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                            <p>Personally, we believe that this is criminal. But as of yet, it appears to be a perfectly legal business model to take full advantage of your customers.</p>
                            <p>And we wish we can tell you that this only happens with brokerage or exchange houses. It doesn’t. This model is prevalent in many industries.</p>
                            <p>The easiest way to spot a business that most likely uses their customers as a product, is by looking for services that are offered for FREE (not a free trial, but free into perpetuity).</p>
                            <p>And while yes, you can make some money in the Casino, those returns are typically limited. They use fancy terms like <strong> “average return” </strong>.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row rt">

                        <br /><br />
                        <p>When you crowdfund a real estate project (similar to syndication, but open to non-accredited and non-sophisticated investors with lower investment requirement), you are typically given a secondary benefit of just allowing your money to grow. In basic terms, you allow your money to grow, similarly to that in stocks or bonds.</p>
                        <p>And while getting a return on your money is important (a goal of investing) and you might be helping a community or provide housing or retail, you don’t have any control over what happens with the project and often you don’t get as many financial benefits.</p>
                        <p>For example, say you decide to invest your money with Fundrise, a very popular real estate crowdfunding platform. You give them money for a project, which they use to build or fix the place. In return for you giving them your money, you get some type of return (again, very similar to stocks and bonds).</p>
                        <p>Depending on your agreement, you could be:</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row rt">

                            <h6 style="font-size:18px"><strong>A partial owner</strong></h6>
                            <p>(this is like owning a share of stock in say Apple) and getting a return on the performance of the asset, based on the number of shares you hold.</p>
                            <p>If they make $1,000 and you own 1%, you get $10 (1% of $1,000). Your return will vary on the performance of the asset and while folks can estimate the return and will display it in “pro-forma” (an estimate of what the business thinks they will make), no one can guarantee it.</p>
                            <p>So, if you put in $100, your return is 10% (assuming that 1% share is $100 when you invested). If you put in $1,000, your return is 1% (again, assuming that 1% ownership is $1,000 when you invested).</p>

                            <p>(sort of like buying a bond or operating like a bank, lending money to a business to grow). </p>
                            <p>In this instance, your return is set by the contract, and often advertised as such, typically ranging between 8% and 15%.</p>
                            <p>While that’s great, you don’t get any ownership of the property and are missing on the ownership benefits, including reduction (sometimes even elimination) of your tax liability.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Once they build or fix the place, they typically refinance (with banks for much lower rates), pay you back your initial investment with interest and then you have to find another investment to put the money to work and depend again on the third party to give you a proper return. They get to keep the place and enjoy all these additional benefits listed above (see the IDEAL section).</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row rt">

                        <p>Syndications do something similar, except the entry price is a bit steeper, typically ranging between $25,000-100,000 per share (instead of $100 or $250 with crowdfunding). The difference with most syndications is that they might perform a combination of debt and equity, where a particular percentage point is guaranteed and any revenue is then shared between the owners. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <p>Another keen difference is that often there are fewer owners and they typically form a partnership, which allows for nearly all benefits of property ownership (if structured correctly). However, one thing that most syndications do not give the investors is ability to vote what happens with the project or leadership… they don’t have <strong>one key component: CONTROL.</strong> </p>
                        <p>So, if we were to choose between those two, assuming those were the only options to get into the real estate investing, we’d go for syndications.</p>
                        <p>However, thankfully, there are other options to get into real estate and that is<strong> 100% OWNERSHIP.</strong></p>

                        <p>Owning the property 100% yourself (even if you finance it) gives you a full access into all of the benefits that property ownership has. But what’s more, it <strong>gives you CONTROL.</strong></p>
                        <p>If you don’t get anything else from this site, understand that CONTROL is what you want in investing, business (and life); ability to direct what happens with the property when and as it makes sense to you.</p>
                        <p>If you were to invest your money with Fundrise, you don’t get to say: “Hey, those shower heads are cheap and break easily. Let’s put in something higher quality.” You have no say in what happens with the project, how it’s being run and operated or what happens to it or your money. You are along for the ride, sort of like a passenger in the back of a car. </p>

                <div style="text-align:justify">
                    <p>You have likely heard that in real estate there are 3 main things to pay attention to:</p>
                    <br /><br />
                    <ol style="margin-left: 80px;">
                        <li><span style="margin-right: 10px;">1.</span>Location </li>
                        <li><span style="margin-right: 10px;">2.</span>Location </li>
                        <li><span style="margin-right: 10px;">3.</span>Location </li>
                    </ol>


                    <br /><br />
                    <p>And while we do agree that <strong>location</strong> is important, there are a few more items that investor must pay attention to.</p>
                    <p>If you were like most individuals who focused on location only, you would have purchased a property in Las Vegas, NV in 2007, just a few months before it all crashed and like most who did that, you would have lost anywhere between 50-80% of your wealth.</p>
                    <p>So, while important it is not everything, as they would like you to believe! </p>
                    <p>There are 5 key components to making the real estate investing even more powerful. Some investors focus on only one or two strategies that make them money. And while that’s great, they are missing a bulk of other items that are incredibly important.</p>
                    <p>The chart explains the 5 major components every investor must pay attention to as they are getting into a deal, if they are to be successful long-term. Of course, the astute investors will realize that there are many more intricacies and details within these 5 that were not even mentioned, like leverage or type of property for example. And they are to be considered within the key parameters as shared below.  </p>

                    <h3 class="f40">What Separates The Intelligent Investors?</h3>
                    <p>If you have been in the world of money, investing, and personal finance for a while, you may have heard of or studied people like Warren Buffet, Robert Kiyosaki, Ray Dalio, The Rothschilds, to name the few. If you have, this next section may be a good reminder of they key concepts. If you haven’t, here is the big picture summary view.</p>
                    <h3 class="f30" style="text-align:left">You Make Money When You Buy…</h3>
                    <p>Robert Kiyosaki is well known for saying the above statement, but many are confused about what he means by that.</p>
                    <p>Most folks buy something and then <strong> hope and pray </strong> it goes up in value. While great for spirit, this is not a good investing strategy!</p>
                    <p>You make money when you buy something that has value and can provide income (definition of an asset), but pay less than the actual value it provides. </p>
                    <p>Let’s use that in an example…</p>
                    <p>Say you buy a <strong> property worth $100,000 </strong> for $100,000, thinking the price will go up… Real estate always goes up, right?! So, when it goes up 50%, WAHOO!</p>
                    <p>Not so fast! 2007 crisis was just a recent example that this kind of thinking is what Zig Ziglar would call: “Stinkin’ Thinkin’”!</p>
                    <p>Because in crisis the price can and does go down, let’s imagine <strong>it goes down</strong>, say <strong>50%.</strong> </p>
                    <p>How much is your <strong>property worth</strong> now? <strong> $50,000</strong>, right? </p>
                    <p>How much did you pay? $100,000, yes?</p>
                    <p><strong>Did you make or lose money?</strong></p>
                    <p>Bummer!</p>
                    <p>In pictures, these two scenarios would look something like this:</p>
                    <div style="margin-left: 232px;">
                        <img src="~/imgs/house1.png" style="max-width: 350px; margin-top: 40px; " />
                        <img src="~/imgs/house2.png" style="max-width: 350px; margin-top: 40px; margin-left:110px; position:absolute" />
                    </div>
                    <br /><br /><br />
                    <p>Now, let’s imagine that<strong> you bought </strong> that same property valued at $100,000<strong> for $10,000.</strong></p>
                    <p>The exact same scenario happens –<strong> market goes down 50%.</strong></p>
                    <p>Did you lose money?!<strong> Could you sell it for market price and still make profit?</strong></p>
                    <p>EXACTLY!</p>
                    <p>And if it goes up, that much better!</p>
                    <p>Again, visually, it would look something like this…</p>
                    <div style="margin-left: 232px;">
                        <img src="~/imgs/house3.png" style="max-width: 350px; margin-top: 40px;" />
                        <img src="~/imgs/house4.png" style="max-width: 350px; margin-top: 40px; margin-left:110px; position:absolute" />
                    </div>
                    <br /><br /><br />
                    <p>This is what he was talking about! </p>
                    <p style=" font-size:24px;font-style:italic;"><strong>Value Investing…</strong></p>
                    <p>Most people credit Warren Buffet for this, however it wasn’t him who thought of it first. Instead it was Benjamin Graham. Buffet is just Graham’s student and one that is in our time.</p>
                    <p>And here are the basics… when you buy something, make sure that <strong> the price you pay is below the value</strong> of the asset you purchase. That’s it!</p>
                    <p>Sounds very similar to what Kiyosaki said, doesn’t it?!</p>
                    <p style=" font-size:24px;font-style:italic;"><strong>Control Is Everything…</strong></p>
                    <p>Final piece is control. If you’ve read other stuff on this page, you understand the importance of controlling your own assets. This is they key that all wealthy and ultra-rich individuals understand and implement. So why not you?!</p>
                    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Control comes from ownership of the asset and the direction in which it will go.</strong></p>
                    <p>Of course, you don’t have control over the economy or the weather or the human behavior… (if you do, we wanna talk to you stat!), but you don’t really need that if you control the asset and can change and shift in your approach and operation with the change of the wind (no seriously, if you can contol those things, let us know).</p>
                    <p>This is how Rotshchilds became who they are… and Medicis… and Rockefellers… and Zuckerberg and Bezos… and everyone else worth multi-zillion dollars (or any other currency you’d like to put in).</p>
                    <p style=" font-size:24px;font-style:italic;"><strong>Speed…</strong></p>
                    <p>But out of everything discussed here<strong> SPEED </strong>is the most important.</p>
                    <p>What good is a deal, if you don’t<strong> find it first?</strong></p>
                    <p>And what good is finding the deal first, if you can’t <strong> discover</strong> whether it’s <strong> a great deal?</strong></p>
                    <p>If what good is a great deal, if you can’t make a fast decision to acquire it? And <strong>fast decisions</strong> are reached by those who have a solution to it all.</p>
                    <p>And this is where we come in…</p>

                            <p>Say there are 3 investors:<strong> Traditional Trey, Value Valery,</strong> and <strong>Advantageous Ada!</strong></p>

                        <div style="margin-top: -712px;position:absolute;margin-left: 240px;color:#174168;font-style: italic;">
                            <p style="
    /* margin-top: -80px; */
"><strong>Traditional Trey </strong>follows the traditional way of finding and investing in deals.<br>He hires realtors to find properties on MLS and pays the full market price.<br>Because he pays the full market price, Traditional Trey relies on market going up,<br>saving like crazy to put down the 20-25% and has to charge premium on his<br>rentals and take a small percentage of appreciation when he flips the property.<br>He can only do about 1 deal every 18 months.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div style="margin-top: -507px;position:absolute;margin-left: 70px;color:#174168;font-style: italic;">

                            <p><strong>Value Valery </strong>understands the value investing, so she knows about all these great deals<br> available for sale on auctions. Every day, Value Valery spends 5 hours or so searching <br>the internet for upcoming auctions and looking for deals. When she finds one, she then <br> spends about 10 hours of deep research on that one property to see if it’s a great deal <br>and whether she should consider buying it. Because it takes her all this time to find <br> and research deals, she can only consider about 5 deals per year.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p style="
    margin-left: 140px;
">And then, there’s <strong>Advantageous Ada </strong>who doesn’t want to spend 18 months to get into<br>a deal and doesn’t have 5 hours per day to drown in the innerwebs. Advantageous Ada<br>would rather spend time with family and friends and thinking strategy. Because<br>Advantageous Ada understands the value investing, the control and the speed of money,<br>finding and researching deals, they decide to get an unfair advantage and sign up with<br><strong style="font-weight:600">Tsaishen</strong>. Within seconds, they have hundreds (maybe even thousands) of deals at their<br>fingertips. They filter deals using their own requirements and sort the properties to fit<br>their criteria. In less than 10 minutes Advantageous Ada finds the properties they like,<br>conducts quick research and executes on the  deal. While Trey is emailing back and<br>forth with an agent and Valery is going from website to website, Ada has completed<br>the search and is in the process of securing the deal.</p>

                    <p>We are you and you are us… </p>
                    <p>Tsaishen is not about a person or a few creators. Heck it’s not even about real estate either… okay, well it is, but it’s so much more than just that!</p>
                    <p>For years, scratch that… <strong>decades…</strong> nope, not quite right… CENTURIES, those born in the right countries, to the right families, and provided with the best teachers and mentors, were the only ones who were ever deemed worthy enough of owning real estate, creating or amassing great wealth. From buildings to land, farms and even towns, they owned it all.</p>
                    <p>On their conquests to own more land, they pillaged the earth, spilling commoners’ blood and those that didn’t die were given a right to work the land, but never own it. And not only did they work it, they had to pay for it too.</p>
                    <p>Things might have changed since that time, but not by much. </p>
                    <p>For many of us, you still have to be blessed enough to be born in the right country to the right parents (who are well connected), be lucky (if connection doesn’t work) to get in the best schools, and brave (or ignorant) enough to carry the debt burden for that education. And if something is amiss, wrong information programmed in your brain (like stocks are the only way to invest) and your dumb luck doesn’t lead you to the right people to create multi-gazillion dollar start-up in your 20’s, you will forever be a slave to a job, working but never owning, and paying dearly for it all (through taxes and inflation).</p>

                                <p>And I tried many different ways to invest in it and have found the most profitable way that one can make money, good money, by purchasing discounted properties (value investing) that are already available online.</p>

And for the past 20 years or so, I have been intimately involved in real estate, investing and teaching, both to full-fledged adults, just like you and to college kids from all over the world.</p>

                                <p>I am happy to share, that I have taught 100,000’s of people, if not even over a million, by this point. And while my teaching is solid, and I wholeheartedly stand behind it, there was a piece missing. </p>
                                <p>The world of discounted or value investing is rather vast and complex. Telling my students to visit 1000’s of websites and read all these books I did to learn and get what they want was a bit too much. </p>
                                <p>I am ashamed to admit that I was like Trey for a while and that I worked like Valery for a very long time. </p>
                                <p>While I knew of the power of technology, I bought into a belief that you couldn’t use it for real estate and the best we could ever get would be platforms like Zillow, Trulia, Realtor, ZipRealty, and Fundrise.</p>
                                <p>But I was wrong!</p>
                                <p>Those are just fancy websites that get you a small portion of what this world can offer. And after waiting for years for someone to create something different, I decided that it had to be me… since frankly, I was tired of waiting.</p>
                                <p>So, I partnered with some of the best minds I could find to put my decades of experience and knowledge into one powerful platform that allows you to leverage my knowledge and experience and combine it with their knowledge to utilize the power of science and technology. </p>

                    <p>Over the last few decades we’ve seen a rise in property prices. Since the crash of 2008 the prices in most places are right back at the same level and even higher in some cities. Individuals looking to invest in real estate simply can’t find great deals, where the price makes (as compared to value or rent that it can demand). Basically, the math doesn’t work.</p>
                    <p>And how do you know whether the math makes sense? </p>
                    <p>Simply compare the price you pay (asking price) to the current market value. Are they the same? </p>
                    <p>If they are, you are leaving much of your wealth to the hope and pray strategy that market will appreciate. Read: <span class="strong">you are taking a lot of risk.</span></p>
                    <p>If your plan is to rent, what is the rent to price ratio?! If you are not taking at least 1% in rent, you might be exposing yourself to negative cash flow (meaning YOU LOSING MONEY every single month). Sure, sometimes you can make the math work for as little as 0.5%, but that too is very risky. As any minor movement swings you from profits to losses. </p>
                    <p>What you want to do is find deals that you can purchase well below the market value!</p>
                    <p>Why?</p>
                    <p>Keep reading and we promise to explain exactly why in a bit…</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>The second and maybe even bigger reason is ability to find deals, or as some like to call it a “deal flow”. Because vast majority of people don’t know where to look, they enlist help of the local realtor, hoping that will expand and speed up their search. They typically drive around the local market, hoping to see a property for sale well below the market price, to give them enough equity to get in.</p>
                    <p>But here is the problem, most sellers are very smart these days. They too have access to Zillow and have at least a range of what price they can demand.  They too have access to realtors who can advise them (for free) of what the price of their property should be. And unless you find someone desperate for cash that hasn’t heard of re-financing or home equity loan or line of credit, you will know on many, many doors and walk out empty-handed.</p>
                    <p>As for realtors, yes, you’ll likely get more deals showing up in your inbox, however don’t expect that any of them will have a good price to value difference.</p>
                    <p>And in case you are super-new to the world of real estate, let us break something else down for you…</p>
                    <p>You’ve likely enlisted the “buyer’s agent” who told you that their service is free – meaning you don’t have to pay them a penny, they only get paid when the deal is closed, and the seller will pay for that. Are we right?!</p>
                    <p>But here is the reality… sellers know that they will have to pay 5-8% of the sale price to the realtors. And they also have a solid expectation of what they’d like to make out of the deal. So price is adjusted to reflect that payment. </p>
                    <p>So, who ultimately pays for the realtors? YOU, the buyer!</p>
                    <p>And while we think it’s cool that they get paid for the service they provide (they do work many hours) we also think it’s fair for you to understand that it’s not free.</p>

                    <p>Even if you know exactly where to go to find great deals online, you’ll most likely end up sifting through 100,000’s of web pages and looking at well over 100 deals just to find 1 deal that makes sense. </p>
                    <p>For experienced investors, this can take about 1 hour per deal. For those starting out, this process can take 3-5 hours per deal or longer. </p>
                    <p>So, if you look at 100 deals and you spend 1-3 hours per deal, that means you are spending 100-300 hours before you can find a great deal. </p>
                    <p>To put this in perspective,<strong> you are spending anywhere between 2.5 and 7.5 workweeks just to find one deal.</strong> </p>
                    <p style=" font-size:19px">That’s over 2 months of searching!</p>
                    <p>And that’s if you can afford spending about 40-hours per week for the entirety of those 2 months looking at what’s out there. If you can’t, that process can take 4-6 months or longer!</p>
                    <p>And then, once you find the deal, you’ll need to spend another 10-50 hours in due diligence (basically a research to tell you whether your initial gut reaction and evaluations were right). </p>
                    <p>That’s simply a lot of time!</p>
                    <p>And you are also competing with other investors who are likely looking at the same deal.</p>
                    <p>The one that finds it faster and can do their research faster wins! And if that’s not you, now you’re back onto another 2+ months of searching!</p>

                    <p>And the process looks something like this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find the pre-foreclosure or distressed property by driving around your neighborhood and looking for signs of distress (overgrown lawn, roof in need of repair, peeling paint, boarded up windows…), or look at obituaries and see if any of those folks had a property being left to the next of kin, or search for foreclosure filings by visiting this site, that site and these articles…</li>
                        <li>Do a quick property research by looking here, here, and here</li>
                        <li>Send a letter to the owner using one of the pre-scripted letters that basically tells them you understand they might be in trouble and you’d like to help. Ask for a phone call or a visit. Or if you are bold enough, just make an offer (typically obscenely low)</li>
                        <li>Call to follow up or send another letter</li>
                        <li>If you get into negotiations, show them how your tiny offer actually helps them and saves them</li>
                        <li>If they accept buy it</li>

                    <p>You feel awful about who you’re becoming and feel embarrassed to tell your friends, family, spouse or kids how you basically take advantage of people when they are at their lowest and spinning it as if you’re doing them a favor! The whole process and even the thoughts of the potential profits start to feel dirty. </p>
                    <p>YUCK!</p>
                    <p>You realize that’s not who you are nor who you wish to become. Soon enough you stop. </p>
                    <p>Some of you get so distraught by the process that you start resenting real estate, investing, and money altogether and create false beliefs that EVERYONE who’s in it must have done it the “yucky” way. You give up on investing completely.</p>
                    <p>Others decide that maybe stocks are better… at least you’re not taking advantage of others… sometimes forgetting that often you are being taken advantage of by the market manipulations and fake news.</p>
                    <p>Now you’ve wasted a lot of time, energy and money, because you followed the old process and the old methodology that simply no longer works!</p>

                    <p>Even though there are problems with traditional way to invest in real estate, it still makes it a great investment and one of the best performing assets in the history of investing… going back to the beginning of civilization.</p>
                    <p>There are only a few assets that one can invest in:</p>
                    <p>While there are subcategories within each, these are the basic investment options one has. And as you can see from the visual, real estate allows you to participate in all of the asset classes.</p>
                    <p>It provides equity, especially when you buy well, ability to utilize debt and finance the property, and finally the commodities are used in the products itself (lumber, copper, etc.).</p>
                    <p>But that’s not where the power of real estate comes in. True <b>power of real estate ownership</b> comes from <b>what it can do for the investor</b> in creating and preserving wealth.</p>
                    <p>You’ve likely heard it called an <b>IDEAL asset:</b></p>

                    <p>We’ll explain some more intricacies in a bit, using the example of crowdfunding and syndications, but there are a few keen differences between those that we’d like to point out here.</p>
                    <p>
                        We like to look at Wall Street like a casino. As a matter of fact, we call it just that,<strong> Wall Street Casino</strong>: <q>While you may win every, ultimately the house never loses!</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even the best investors call entry points “bets” (just listen to Ray Dalio, arguably one of the most successful investors) and that is for a reason. When you get into a Wall Street Casino, you are speculating (guessing) of what may happen and in which direction the prices may go. Aside from lack of control of what the company or leadership does, you depend on the market (meaning millions of people out there) behavior and beliefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If that wasn’t complex enough,<strong> market and the prices are easily manipulated </strong> in the background and not made public. And those manipulations are not to your benefit, just in case you were wondering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many ways to manipulate the market and the stock price, some illegal and some legal, but, in our opinion, unethical.

                        Nowadays humans are not the only gamblers inside the casino. The place is filled with <strong> highly sophisticated robots </strong> that do all the buying and selling, using specially designed algorithms to make money for, you guessed it, guys who built them, and they can do it so fast that it would make your head spin.
                    </p>



                    <p>
                        And look, we got nothing against bots! Heck we use them to. But, we tend to believe in using them for good and not being evil.

                    <p>
                        For example, Robinhood (popular app allowing you to gamble in the casino free of fees) uses their customer data to make the profit and beat their customer! YUP, their own customer is used as a product!

                        Here is how it works:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You decide you want to buy 10 shares of Netflix. You enter the amount and press the button.</li>

                        <li>
                            During those few seconds, Robinhood bots, knowing your estimated price,
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    have traded that stock multiple times already (this is done in milliseconds), making the money on the spread (the difference between buy and sell price) AND/OR
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    have purchased those 10 shares BELOW your price and then SOLD THEM TO YOU at the price you agreed to pay, making HUGE PROFITS in the process
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>
                            When you decide to sell, they use the exact same process in reverse, basically doubling or tripling money every time you press that button.

                    <p>Personally, we believe that this is criminal. But as of yet, it appears to be a perfectly legal business model to take full advantage of your customers.</p>
                    <p>And we wish we can tell you that this only happens with brokerage or exchange houses. It doesn’t. This model is prevalent in many industries.</p>
                    <p>The easiest way to spot a business that most likely uses their customers as a product, is by looking for services that are offered for FREE (not a free trial, but free into perpetuity).</p>
                    <p>And while yes, you can make some money in the Casino, those returns are typically limited. They use fancy terms like <strong> “average return” </strong>.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>When you crowdfund a real estate project (similar to syndication, but open to non-accredited and non-sophisticated investors with lower investment requirement), you are typically given a secondary benefit of just allowing your money to grow. In basic terms, you allow your money to grow, similarly to that in stocks or bonds.</p>
                    <p>And while getting a return on your money is important (a goal of investing) and you might be helping a community or provide housing or retail, you don’t have any control over what happens with the project and often you don’t get as many financial benefits.</p>
                    <p>For example, say you decide to invest your money with Fundrise, a very popular real estate crowdfunding platform. You give them money for a project, which they use to build or fix the place. In return for you giving them your money, you get some type of return (again, very similar to stocks and bonds).</p>
                    <p>Depending on your agreement, you could be:</p>
                    <h6 class="f30"><strong>A partial owner</strong></h6>
                    <p>(this is like owning a share of stock in say Apple) and getting a return on the performance of the asset, based on the number of shares you hold.</p>
                    <p>If they make $1,000 and you own 1%, you get $10 (1% of $1,000). Your return will vary on the performance of the asset and while folks can estimate the return and will display it in “pro-forma” (an estimate of what the business thinks they will make), no one can guarantee it.</p>
                    <p>So, if you put in $100, your return is 10% (assuming that 1% share is $100 when you invested). If you put in $1,000, your return is 1% (again, assuming that 1% ownership is $1,000 when you invested).</p>

                    <p>(sort of like buying a bond or operating like a bank, lending money to a business to grow). </p>
                    <p>In this instance, your return is set by the contract, and often advertised as such, typically ranging between 8% and 15%.</p>
                    <p>While that’s great, you don’t get any ownership of the property and are missing on the ownership benefits, including reduction (sometimes even elimination) of your tax liability.</p>
                    <p>Once they build or fix the place, they typically refinance (with banks for much lower rates), pay you back your initial investment with interest and then you have to find another investment to put the money to work and depend again on the third party to give you a proper return. They get to keep the place and enjoy all these additional benefits listed above (see the IDEAL section).</p>

                    <p>Syndications do something similar, except the entry price is a bit steeper, typically ranging between $25,000-100,000 per share (instead of $100 or $250 with crowdfunding). The difference with most syndications is that they might perform a combination of debt and equity, where a particular percentage point is guaranteed and any revenue is then shared between the owners. </p>
                    <p>Another keen difference is that often there are fewer owners and they typically form a partnership, which allows for nearly all benefits of property ownership (if structured correctly). However, one thing that most syndications do not give the investors is ability to vote what happens with the project or leadership… they don’t have <strong>one key component: CONTROL.</strong> </p>
                    <p>So, if we were to choose between those two, assuming those were the only options to get into the real estate investing, we’d go for syndications.</p>
                    <p>However, thankfully, there are other options to get into real estate and that is<strong> 100% OWNERSHIP.</strong></p>

                    <p>Owning the property 100% yourself (even if you finance it) gives you a full access into all of the benefits that property ownership has. But what’s more, it <strong>gives you CONTROL.</strong></p>
                    <p>If you don’t get anything else from this site, understand that CONTROL is what you want in investing, business (and life); ability to direct what happens with the property when and as it makes sense to you.</p>
                    <p>If you were to invest your money with Fundrise, you don’t get to say: “Hey, those shower heads are cheap and break easily. Let’s put in something higher quality.” You have no say in what happens with the project, how it’s being run and operated or what happens to it or your money. You are along for the ride, sort of like a passenger in the back of a car. </p>

                    <p>When you own the place yourself, you have full control! You get to decide what you buy, where, when, and how you buy and above all, you get to decide what happens with the place!</p>
                    <p>Want to rent it? Got for it!</p>
                    <p>Want to flip it? Yup, you can do that!</p>

                    <p><strong>100% ownership means 100% control</strong> of what happens with your investment… your money… your wealth!</p>
                    <p>And above all, you get ALL the possible deductions come tax time!</p>
                    <p>So now, instead of getting 10-15% return, which by the way most real estate investors who own the place get through income alone, your return can be something closer to 30-50% when you account for all the other aspects of property ownership (depreciation, tax reduction, etc.).</p>
                    <p>That is the difference! Do you want to double your money every 10 or 2 years?</p>

                    <p>You have likely heard that in real estate there are 3 main things to pay attention to:</p>
                    <br /><br />
                    <ol>
                        <li><span></span>Location </li>
                        <li><span></span>Location </li>
                        <li><span></span>Location </li>
                    </ol>


                    <br /><br />
                    <p>And while we do agree that <strong>location</strong> is important, there are a few more items that investor must pay attention to.</p>
                    <p>If you were like most individuals who focused on location only, you would have purchased a property in Las Vegas, NV in 2007, just a few months before it all crashed and like most who did that, you would have lost anywhere between 50-80% of your wealth.</p>
                    <p>So, while important it is not everything, as they would like you to believe! </p>
                    <p>There are 5 key components to making the real estate investing even more powerful. Some investors focus on only one or two strategies that make them money. And while that’s great, they are missing a bulk of other items that are incredibly important.</p>
                    <p>The chart explains the 5 major components every investor must pay attention to as they are getting into a deal, if they are to be successful long-term. Of course, the astute investors will realize that there are many more intricacies and details within these 5 that were not even mentioned, like leverage or type of property for example. And they are to be considered within the key parameters as shared below.  </p>

                    <h3 class="f40">What Separates The Intelligent Investors?</h3>
                    <p>If you have been in the world of money, investing, and personal finance for a while, you may have heard of or studied people like Warren Buffet, Robert Kiyosaki, Ray Dalio, The Rothschilds, to name the few. If you have, this next section may be a good reminder of they key concepts. If you haven’t, here is the big picture summary view.</p>
                    <h3 class="f30" style="text-align:left">You Make Money When You Buy…</h3>
                    <p>Robert Kiyosaki is well known for saying the above statement, but many are confused about what he means by that.</p>
                    <p>Most folks buy something and then <strong> hope and pray </strong> it goes up in value. While great for spirit, this is not a good investing strategy!</p>
                    <p>You make money when you buy something that has value and can provide income (definition of an asset), but pay less than the actual value it provides. </p>
                    <p>Let’s use that in an example…</p>
                    <p>Say you buy a <strong> property worth $100,000 </strong> for $100,000, thinking the price will go up… Real estate always goes up, right?! So, when it goes up 50%, WAHOO!</p>
                    <p>Not so fast! 2007 crisis was just a recent example that this kind of thinking is what Zig Ziglar would call: “Stinkin’ Thinkin’”!</p>
                    <p>Because in crisis the price can and does go down, let’s imagine <strong>it goes down</strong>, say <strong>50%.</strong> </p>
                    <p>How much is your <strong>property worth</strong> now? <strong> $50,000</strong>, right? </p>
                    <p>How much did you pay? $100,000, yes?</p>
                    <p><strong>Did you make or lose money?</strong></p>
                    <p>Bummer!</p>
                    <p>In pictures, these two scenarios would look something like this:</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <br />
                    <img src="~/imgs/house1.png" style="width:100%" />
                    <img src="~/imgs/house2.png" style="width:100%" />

                    <br /><br /><br />
                    <p>Now, let’s imagine that<strong> you bought </strong> that same property valued at $100,000<strong> for $10,000.</strong></p>
                    <p>The exact same scenario happens –<strong> market goes down 50%.</strong></p>
                    <p>Did you lose money?!<strong> Could you sell it for market price and still make profit?</strong></p>
                    <p>EXACTLY!</p>
                    <p>And if it goes up, that much better!</p>
                    <p>Again, visually, it would look something like this…</p>
                    <br />
                    <img src="~/imgs/house3.png" style="width:100%" />
                    <img src="~/imgs/house4.png" style="width:100%" />

                    <br /><br /><br />
                    <p>This is what he was talking about! </p>
                    <p class="f30"><strong>Value Investing…</strong></p>
                    <p>Most people credit Warren Buffet for this, however it wasn’t him who thought of it first. Instead it was Benjamin Graham. Buffet is just Graham’s student and one that is in our time.</p>
                    <p>And here are the basics… when you buy something, make sure that <strong> the price you pay is below the value</strong> of the asset you purchase. That’s it!</p>
                    <p>Sounds very similar to what Kiyosaki said, doesn’t it?!</p>
                    <p class="f30"><strong>Control Is Everything…</strong></p>
                    <p>Final piece is control. If you’ve read other stuff on this page, you understand the importance of controlling your own assets. This is they key that all wealthy and ultra-rich individuals understand and implement. So why not you?!</p>
                    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Control comes from ownership of the asset and the direction in which it will go.</strong></p>
                    <p>Of course, you don’t have control over the economy or the weather or the human behavior… (if you do, we wanna talk to you stat!), but you don’t really need that if you control the asset and can change and shift in your approach and operation with the change of the wind (no seriously, if you can contol those things, let us know).</p>
                    <p>This is how Rotshchilds became who they are… and Medicis… and Rockefellers… and Zuckerberg and Bezos… and everyone else worth multi-zillion dollars (or any other currency you’d like to put in).</p>
                    <p class="f30"><strong>Speed…</strong></p>
                    <p>But out of everything discussed here<strong> SPEED </strong>is the most important.</p>
                    <p>What good is a deal, if you don’t<strong> find it first?</strong></p>
                    <p>And what good is finding the deal first, if you can’t <strong> discover</strong> whether it’s <strong> a great deal?</strong></p>
                    <p>If what good is a great deal, if you can’t make a fast decision to acquire it? And <strong>fast decisions</strong> are reached by those who have a solution to it all.</p>
                    <p>And this is where we come in…</p>

                    <p>We are you and you are us… </p>
                    <p>Tsaishen is not about a person or a few creators. Heck it’s not even about real estate either… okay, well it is, but it’s so much more than just that!</p>
                    <p>For years, scratch that… <strong>decades…</strong> nope, not quite right… CENTURIES, those born in the right countries, to the right families, and provided with the best teachers and mentors, were the only ones who were ever deemed worthy enough of owning real estate, creating or amassing great wealth. From buildings to land, farms and even towns, they owned it all.</p>
                    <p>On their conquests to own more land, they pillaged the earth, spilling commoners’ blood and those that didn’t die were given a right to work the land, but never own it. And not only did they work it, they had to pay for it too.</p>
                    <p>Things might have changed since that time, but not by much. </p>
                    <p>For many of us, you still have to be blessed enough to be born in the right country to the right parents (who are well connected), be lucky (if connection doesn’t work) to get in the best schools, and brave (or ignorant) enough to carry the debt burden for that education. And if something is amiss, wrong information programmed in your brain (like stocks are the only way to invest) and your dumb luck doesn’t lead you to the right people to create multi-gazillion dollar start-up in your 20’s, you will forever be a slave to a job, working but never owning, and paying dearly for it all (through taxes and inflation).</p>

                    <p>My name is Nev Kraguljevic and for decades I have been searching for a way to create an easier way to create wealth in my life. I tried investing in just about anything you can think of, but it was the study of the wealth creation, money, and finance that has ultimately led me to one asset class: Real Estate. </p>
                    <p>And I tried many different ways to invest in it and have found the most profitable way that one can make money, good money, by purchasing discounted properties (value investing) that are already available online.</p>
                    <p>Once I started to gain traction with my venture, I have been asked to teach others. And for the past 20 years or so, I have been intimately involved in real estate, investing and teaching, both to full-fledged adults, just like you and to college kids from all over the world.</p>

                    <p>I am happy to share, that I have taught 100,000’s of people, if not even over a million, by this point. And while my teaching is solid, and I wholeheartedly stand behind it, there was a piece missing. </p>
                    <p>The world of discounted or value investing is rather vast and complex. Telling my students to visit 1000’s of websites and read all these books I did to learn and get what they want was a bit too much. </p>
                    <p>I am ashamed to admit that I was like Trey for a while and that I worked like Valery for a very long time. </p>
                    <p>While I knew of the power of technology, I bought into a belief that you couldn’t use it for real estate and the best we could ever get would be platforms like Zillow, Trulia, Realtor, ZipRealty, and Fundrise.</p>
                    <p>But I was wrong!</p>
                    <p>Those are just fancy websites that get you a small portion of what this world can offer. And after waiting for years for someone to create something different, I decided that it had to be me… since frankly, I was tired of waiting.</p>
                    <p>So, I partnered with some of the best minds I could find to put my decades of experience and knowledge into one powerful platform that allows you to leverage my knowledge and experience and combine it with their knowledge to utilize the power of science and technology. </p>
                    <p>The combined works is Tsaishen!</p>
